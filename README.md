####Project Brief

#####Objectives The purpose of this project is to allow users to search for an Airport and to view live Arrivals/Departures for that Airport.

You should be able to search for an airport
once selected you can then view the live arrivals for that airport
Clicking on a flight number should provide some information about that flight number such as Airline and type of plane
#####Requirements

As a user I can search for airports
As a user I can view live arrival information
As a user I can see information about a flight about a flight such as Flight Number, Airline, Plane Type, Departure & Arrival Airport detail

####How to Use! 
The Application home has a search input field which will return a table of airports. As some users don't know city codes, IATA & ICOA codes, we recommend that user enter their city/country to find airports. Hint: The application will narrow down the results using classification to pick up the most used airports. The page render the results with be a link from the results called "View Arrivals/Departures". Click on the link "View Arrivals/Departures" the app will redirect you the user to a new page that will contain arrival/departure information of the selected airport. The Flight details link once clicked will again redirect to another page that will show the relevant details of the desired flight chosen e.g. Arrival Terminal, Time and date, Airline name, flightId.

This application is no longer working because of the API however if a new API key is plugged in it will work fine.
